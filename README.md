# IAT-PyQt_OOP
**Implicit Association Test Investigating Implicit Bias on Homosexuality using PyQt with Object-oriented programming** <br>
In the present project, I used PyQt and object-oriented programming to construct an implicit association test that aims to investigate people's implicit bias towards homosexuality.  

**'ExperimentalManual.pdf'** explains the background, rationale, procedure, what each document entails, and what can other researchers make changes to if they want to replicate or change the variables of the study. <br>
**'main.py'**, **'basicSetting.py'**, **'iat.py'**, and **'keyboard.py'** are python files that programmed the iat study. <br>
**'homo.png'** and **'hetero.png'** are iat stimuli. <br>
**'results.csv'** and **'demographic.csv'** records participants' reaction time and their demographic characteristics.<br>
**'manyPages.ui'** creates the iat experiment interface. <br>

To start the experiment, install PyQt and run **'main.py'**. <br>
See more information about experimental design and changing of stimuli/variables in **'ExperimentalManual.pdf'**.<br>

Have fun! :)
